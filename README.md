# VanillaDisable

## Description

This is a fabric/quilt/neoforge mod that allows you to toggle or change many vanilla features through a command or GUI. Please see the wiki for instructions. I try to support the latest version of Minecraft. Mod compatibility is an aim but not always a reality.

## Downloads

You can download stable releases of the mod from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/VanillaDisable/releases) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanilla-disable).

## Dependencies/JIJs/Recommendations

This mod has no hard dependencies, and will run on its own. However, installing [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for Fabric or [Quilted Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) for Quilt is suggested. This mod also has some libraries included in the jar, which leads to the increased file size. You can read about these in [the wiki](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/VanillaDisable/wiki/Dependencies#jij). 

## Other

The wiki page contains information for development, more detailed installation instructions, info about the config system and properties, information about the mixin configuration system, and details about the choice of modloader and version.

## License

This mod is available under the [MPL 2.0](LICENSE) license. Some libraries included in the jar may be available under different licenses, and are listed in [the wiki](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/VanillaDisable/wiki/Dependencies#jij).
